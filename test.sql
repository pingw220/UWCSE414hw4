/*
b.
So in this relational scheme I created based off the given E/R diagram, 
the insures relation is shown through the insures table. I picked this 
representation because as per the E/R diagram, the insures relationships 
connects an insurance company to a vehicle (and has unique attribute 
maxLiability). The insures table captures this relationship by including 
the foreign keys to both tables (InsuranceCo & Vehicle). This means that 
it represents the insurance company and the vehicle respectively, and with 
the maxLiability attribute to store the max liability amount the insurance 
company would have to cover for that particular vehicle.

c. 
From my schema, the two tables Drives and operates represent the two 
relationships with drives and operates. Theyâ€™re different since drives refers 
to the action of any driver driving a vehicle so the driver table links the 
driver table to the vehicle table. For the latter, operates is specific to 
professional drivers using trucks so the operate table links the ProfessionalDriver 
table to the Truck table. The way I thought about it is a normal person driving 
to work versus an Amazon delivery driver. With all this said, this means that 
while any driver can be technically associated with driving a vehicle, only 
professional drivers are associated with operating trucks (aligns with the 
constraints of the relationships).
